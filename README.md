# Social_Media_E-Commerce_App
It is a internship assignment
Building a fully functional social media app with the given requirements will require a considerable amount of time and code due to the extensive features and backend integration involved. I'll outline the project structure, core features, and provide code samples for essential components to guide you through each part. Hosting this app is possible on free platforms like Render (for backend) and Vercel or Netlify (for frontend).

Letâ€™s break down the solution into key areas.

Project Structure
Backend (Node.js/Express):
Authentication (authRoutes.js): Signup/Login and JWT implementation.
Post Management (postRoutes.js): CRUD operations for posts and likes.
Commenting (commentRoutes.js): CRUD operations for comments.
Follow System (followRoutes.js): Follow/Unfollow functionalities.
Real-Time Chat (chatRoutes.js and socket.js for WebSocket integration).
Notification System (emails and in-app).
Frontend (React/Redux):
Authentication (Context API for session handling).
Redux for Posts/Comments: Global state for managing posts, likes, and comments.
Real-Time Chat with WebSockets.
In-app notifications for interactions.
